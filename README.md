# fantastic-umbrella

For this project, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is used to create the back end of a internet retail company. This project uses Espress.js as well as Sequelize and MySQL.

Using the back end and insomnia, this project allows the user to GET, POST and DELETE for categories, tags, and products.
